1.4.3 
Introduces tweaks to the UI to make it more intuitive and readable. Also inlcudes a major bug fix to the humidity status message.

UI changes:
*The humidity status code was drastically shortened to only take up 5 characters and the temperature status message was lengthened
to 5 characters. This will improve readability. Status codes now include for temperature tCold, tGood, and tHot to show the temp
as being cold, acceptable, or hot. Humidity status messages now include hLow, hGood, hHigh 
to show humidity is too low, acceptable, or high.

Bug fixes since 1.4.2:
Major system bug:
*Fixed error with humidity comparison logic in the humidStatus function.
  Previously it checked if humidity was too low by comparing the humidity to the UPPER constant instead of LOWER.
  This caused the humidity to always read too high or too low. It now compares against the LOWER constant.

UI bug fixes
*Fixed issues with LCD screen failing to clear old values in the status messages; 
  particularly noticeable for the AOn/AOff code.
*Adjusted indentation and spacing for the %Rh label so that it no longer gets cut off.
